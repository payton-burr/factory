# Plan Tests

> **Spine position:** Between `slice-tasks` and `plan-work` for epics with `risk: P0|P1`. Optional (can be waived in `state.yaml`) for P2/P3.

Bridges the gap between slicing and planning by systematically designing the test suite as a first-class system. Produces `specs/tech-architecture/eNN-TEST_PLAN_LATEST.md`.

## Pre-flight
- Read `specs/epics/eNN-*/` story list.

## Core Workflow
1. **Analyze Epic**: Read sliced stories in the active epic capsule.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Map behaviors to P0–P3 risk tiers.
3. **Level Strategy**: Classify each scenario (Unit, Integration, E2E).
4. **Fixture Design**: Plan factories, network intercepts, mocks (see REFERENCE.md).
5. **NFR Plan**: Define verifiable commands for Non-Functional Requirements. Skip if `--lite`.
6. **Publish**: Generate `specs/tech-architecture/eNN-TEST_PLAN_LATEST.md`.

## Hard Gates & Guardrails
- **DO NOT** write test code or production code during this skill.
- Scenario ID format MUST be: `SC-eNNsYY-P{0|1|2|3}-NN`.
- `plan-work` MUST reference these scenario IDs in its §17 Gherkin acceptance criteria.
- Default to pushing tests to the lowest possible level.

## Execution Modes
- `$bmad plan-tests`: Standard execution.
- `$bmad plan-tests --lite`: Skips NFRs and complex fixture planning.

## Verify

→ verify: `test -f specs/tech-architecture/e32-TEST_PLAN_LATEST.md`

## Handoff

Gate: READY -> next: plan-work
Writes: state.yaml handoff.next_skill = plan-work
