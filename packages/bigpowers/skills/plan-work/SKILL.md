# Plan Work

> **Spine position:** Step 3 — scope-work → slice-tasks → plan-work.

Produce a detailed, verifiable implementation plan in the **active epic capsule directory** (`specs/epics/eNN-slug/`). Output: a story spec `.md` file (countable-story-format) and a decoupled `eNNsYY-tasks.yaml` with runnable verify commands. "I think it works" is not a step.

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT proceed with a plan until the task's success criteria are clear. If success is ambiguous, convert the task into "step → verify: `<cmd>`" pairs here before writing tasks — every task ships a runnable `verify:` or the plan is not done.
>
> **RECURSIVE DISCIPLINE** — This lifecycle applies to EVERY task, including updating these skills. Never skip planning because a task is "meta" or "just documentation."

## Pre-flight

Read: `release-plan.yaml`, `product/SCOPE_LATEST.yaml`, active `epics/<capsule>/epic.yaml`, `tech-architecture/tech-stack.md`, `product/GLOSSARY_LATEST.yaml`.

> **ZOOM-OUT MANDATE** (v1.17.0) — If modifying an existing module: (1) State the module's **purpose**. (2) Name its **callers**. (3) List its **contracts**. Cannot answer all three? Stop — scope is misunderstood.

If this plan touches an existing module, run `assess-impact` first to understand blast radius.

> **DISCOVERY MANDATE** (v1.18.0) — For external API integration, verify the API signature via local docs or search and quote at least one technical detail in the step's context.

> **MULTIPLE INTERPRETATIONS (HARD GATE)** — If the task admits ≥2 valid interpretations, list them and get a user decision before drafting any steps.

> **COMPLEXITY PUSHBACK (HARD GATE)** — Every new abstraction MUST include a one-sentence "Reason for Depth." If it can't be filled non-trivially, the abstraction is premature — use inline code instead.

> **SLOPCHECK (HARD GATE)** — For every external package, tag it `[OK]`, `[SUS]`, or `[SLOP]`. `[SUS]`/`[SLOP]` require human approval before execution.

## Invocation modes

- Default: full plan with zoom-out mandate, impact assessment, slopcheck
- `--fast`: Skip zoom-out and impact assessment. Use for tasks under 3 BCPs with no module interface changes.

## Process

> **Timing:** `bash ../../scripts/bp-timing.sh start plan-work` at invocation; `bash ../../scripts/bp-timing.sh end plan-work` before handoff.

1. **Explore** — Use `Explore` subagent to understand affected modules, existing test patterns, similar prior art, and dependencies.

2. **Draft steps** — Break implementation into the smallest possible steps where each step leaves the codebase working, has one observable outcome, and can be verified with a single command. Red-flag check: name any rationalization you caught before moving to step 3.

3. **Write capsule story spec + tasks** — Output two files inside the active epic capsule. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for file formats and the plan-template. Each task MUST include a `risk:` field (`P0` | `P1` | `P2` | `P3`) based on BCP + story type heuristics (see REFERENCE.md). If a test plan artifact (`specs/tech-architecture/eNN-TEST_PLAN_LATEST.md`) exists, read it and inherit its P0/P1 risk classifications and scenario IDs (`SC-eNNsYY-P0-NN`). Each task optionally includes a `security:` field (`none` / `low` / `medium` / `high`) sourced from the epic's `specs/security/epics/<id>/THREAT_MODEL.md`. Tasks with `security: medium` or `security: high` MUST include "no new security findings in affected paths" in their verify steps. Each task should also include an `allure:` block to drive test reporting: `severity:` maps risk to Allure severity (`P0→critical`, `P1→high`, `P2→normal`, `P3→minor`), and `categories:` is a list of relevant tags like `"Security Review"`, wave names, or test categories (see REFERENCE.md for the full template).

   **Requirement delta tags (e45s29):** When a story modifies existing behavior, the story spec § Requirements MUST use OpenSpec-style delta tags with mandatory before/after content:

   | Tag | When | Required content |
   |-----|------|------------------|
   | `ADDED` | New requirement | Full requirement text |
   | `MODIFIED` | Changed behavior | **Before:** prior behavior · **After:** new behavior |
   | `REMOVED` | Retired requirement | **Before:** what existed · **After:** (removed) + rationale |
   | `RENAMED` | ID or title change only | **Before:** old ID/title · **After:** new ID/title |

   Net-new stories (greenfield) use `ADDED` only. `MODIFIED`/`REMOVED`/`RENAMED` without before/after blocks fail the plan-work gate.

4. **Verify step format** — Every step MUST follow: `N. <What to do> → verify: <runnable command>`. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for good/bad examples.

4a. **Cross-artifact consistency pass (HARD GATE — e45s04)** — Before handoff, run:

```bash
bash ../../scripts/lib/plan-consistency-check.sh specs/epics/<capsule>/
```

Print CRITICAL / HIGH / MED findings. **CRITICAL or HIGH blocks code generation** — fix capsule artifacts first. MED requires explicit user acknowledgment.

4b. **tasks.yaml failing ledger (e45s06)** — Every new task entry starts with `status: failing`. Only flip to `status: passing` after its `verify:` command exits 0 during `develop-tdd` or `verify-work`. Never pre-mark passing at plan time.

5. **Review with user** — Confirm step order, granularity, and that verify commands are runnable in this project.

## Lifecycle Gates (e45s09)

| Gate | When | Pass condition |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Pre-Implementation** | Before `kickoff-branch` / first RED commit | Root-cause stated for bugs; `assess-impact` done for module changes; plan-consistency-check PASS |
| **Validation** | Story marked done | All tasks `status: passing`; verify evidence in `specs/verifications/` |
| **Reopen-don't-refile** | Regression on shipped story | Reopen existing story/bug — do not create duplicate capsule entries |

After writing capsule tasks, suggest `kickoff-branch` (if not already on a feature branch) then `build-epic`, `execute-plan`, or `develop-tdd`.

## Verify

→ verify: `test -f ../../scripts/lib/plan-consistency-check.sh && EPIC=$(ls -d specs/epics/*/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v archive | sort | head -1) && test -n "$EPIC" && bash ../../scripts/lib/plan-consistency-check.sh "$EPIC" >/dev/null 2>&1`



## Handoff

Gate: READY -> next: kickoff-branch
Writes: state.yaml handoff.next_skill = kickoff-branch
