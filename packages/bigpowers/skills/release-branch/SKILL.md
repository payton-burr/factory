description: Make the merge/PR/keep/discard decision for a feature branch, verify coverage gates, create the PR with gh, and clean up the worktree. Use when a feature is done and ready to ship, or when user says "release", "merge", or "open a PR".

# Release Branch

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT merge or release if tests fail or if coverage gates are not met. If the branch is red, return to `develop-tdd` to fix regressions or add missing tests before proceeding.

Finalize a completed feature branch: verify coverage gates, integrate onto `main`, and clean up the worktree.

## Additional modes
- `--hotfix`: Cherry-pick to main + tag. Skip PR in solo.
- `--squash-state`: Squash `chore(state):` commits before merge.

## Integrate mode

Read `specs/state.yaml` key `workflow_mode` (`team-pr` | `solo-git`). Fall back to `../../profiles/solo-git.md`.

| Mode | When | Ship path |
|------|------|-----------|
| **solo-local** | `workflow_mode: solo-git` | Auto: `../../scripts/land-branch.sh` if present, else fallback (Step 5) |
| **team-pr** | `workflow_mode: team-pr` (default) | `gh pr create` → `gh pr merge --squash` |

If unsure, prefer **solo-local**. Also read `state.yaml` `vcs.kind`: Git follows the procedures below; Jujutsu uses workspaces/bookmarks and must not call Git-only landing scripts.

## Process

> **Timing:** `bash ../../scripts/bp-timing.sh start release-branch` at invocation; `bash ../../scripts/bp-timing.sh end release-branch` before handoff.

### 1. Final verification

```bash
<full test command> && <typecheck command> && <lint command>
git log main...HEAD --oneline | grep -vE "^[a-f0-9]+ (feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(\(.+\))?!?: .+$" && echo "❌ Non-conventional commits found" || echo "✅ Commits verified"
# Block AI agent attribution (P1)
git log main...HEAD --format="%B" | grep -qiE 'co[- ]authored[- ]by' && echo "❌ Co-authored-by footer found — blocked" || echo "✅ No AI attribution"
```

- [ ] All tests pass, no type errors, no lint violations, all commits follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] **NO `Co-authored-by` or `Co-Authored-By`** in any commit body — P1 rule (CONVENTIONS.md § Git Attribution). `land-branch.sh` blocks the merge if found.

### 2. Coverage check

- [ ] Overall coverage ≥ 80%; business logic coverage ≥ 95%

### 2a. Security gate

- [ ] `specs/security/REVIEW.md` exists and is fresh (matches current branch diff)
- [ ] No unresolved HIGH findings with confidence ≥ 8 (or all documented in `specs/security/EXCEPTIONS.md` with sign-off rationale)

If REVIEW.md is missing or stale → run `security-review` inline. Findings block the merge unless documented in EXCEPTIONS.md.

### 2b. Traceability gate

Run `gate-trace` before merge. FAIL blocks merge; CONCERNS requires explicit override in `specs/state.yaml` (`traceability_override: CONCERNS accepted, reason: <explanation>`). WAIVED if no matrix available.

> **Adversarial refute framing (e45s32):** The final pre-merge check is **refute, not rubber-stamp**. Before declaring ready, actively try to disprove traceability completeness — missing story tags, absent verify evidence, stale security review. Only proceed when refutation fails.

### 3. Diff review

- [ ] All commits intentional, no secrets, CONVENTIONS.md compliance

### 4. Decision

Options: **Release (solo-local)** / **Open PR** / **Keep branch** / **Discard**

### 5. Integrate

Run `commit-message` first. Git solo-local uses `land-branch.sh`. Jujutsu team mode explicitly advances and pushes a bookmark; `-m` is mandatory for commit/describe operations:

```bash
# Git solo-local
bash ../../scripts/land-branch.sh <task-slug> "feat(scope): description"
# Jujutsu team PR
jj describe -m "feat(scope): description"
jj bookmark set <task-slug> -r @
jj git push -b <task-slug>
```

Jujutsu solo-local landing is unsupported: run `bp_require_vcs_operation "$PWD" land-branch` and stop with its remediation instead of invoking the Git backend.

### 6. Create PR (team-pr only)

Create the pull request with a **literal provenance marker** in the body so agent-generated PRs are identifiable and do not rot silently:

```markdown
<!-- bigpowers-provenance: agent-generated -->
```

Place the marker on its own line immediately after the `## Summary` heading. Then merge via `gh`:

```bash
gh pr create --title "..." --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<!-- bigpowers-provenance: agent-generated -->

- ...

## Test plan
- [ ] ...

EOF
)"
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

`semantic-release` auto-detects the commit, bumps SemVer, tags the repo, generates release notes.

### 7a. Archive completed epic capsule

> **HARD GATE** — When all epic stories are done (all `done` in `execution-status.yaml`), archive the capsule:

```bash
mv specs/epics/eNN-slug specs/epics/archive/
```

### 7b. CI verification & agent lock release (e39s02)

> **HARD GATE** — Do NOT declare success until CI completes. **Three-independent-facts** (e45s15): commit landed, workflow green, registry visible — see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#three-independent-facts-release).

```bash
bash ../../scripts/wait-for-ci.sh --timeout 600 --interval 30
```

- [ ] CI passes; `release.ci_verified: true` in state.yaml
- On failure: `handoff.next_skill = fix-bug`

### 8. Clean up & return

Git: prune worktree, delete branch, return to main. Jujutsu: `jj workspace forget <workspace>` only after integration; do not delete its bookmark implicitly. Cycle-time: see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#cycle-time).

Report: "Branch released."

## Verify

→ verify: `command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1 && test -f specs/state.yaml && test -d ../../skills/verify-work`
